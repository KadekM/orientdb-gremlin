# orientdb-gremlin
TP3 driver for orientdb

This is just a proof of concept, nowhere ready to use. But the structure is there, and we can get vertices and their properties. 
If you would like to help: there's lot's of `throw NotImplementedException()` and TODOs in the codebase, here's just a few of them:

* implement edge lookups
* use indexes for vertex lookup by id
* label lookup for both edge and vertex
* implement all the standard tests for vendor implementation
