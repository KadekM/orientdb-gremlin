# orientdb-gremlin
TP3 driver for orientdb

For now this is just a proof of concept, nowhere ready to use in production. But the structure is there, and it
supports basic traversals. The easiest way to give it a shot is to use the orientdb project inside
[gremlin-scala-examples]([https://github.com/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala-examples).

If you run into a `NotImplementedException()` then it's a sign that you should help ;)
